            <p class="lede">
              Phlux enables operators to extract more value from existing operational data by inferring key
              quantities that are difficult, costly, or impractical to measure directly. The emphasis is on scalable insight — solutions that
              can be validated on one asset and extended across similar systems without increasing field complexity.
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              Rather than introducing new instrumentation, Phlux leverages patterns in operational behavior to deliver reliable estimates of
              flow, system behavior, and equipment condition. This approach lowers deployment cost and enables solutions to scale across equipment with similar
              operating and physical characteristics.

            <h2>Value Drivers</h2>

            <p class="lede">
              By inferring key quantities from existing signals, Phlux avoids many of the cost and operational
              constraints associated with traditional hardware-heavy approaches.

                <h3>Lower deployment friction</h3>
                <p>
                  No need to purchase, install, or maintain additional field hardware. Inference is deployed
                  in software, avoiding production shutdowns, hot work, and instrumentation lead times when adding or fixing existing
                  equipment.

                <h3>Scalability</h3>
                <p>
                  Once validated on one asset, inference models can often be extended across equipment or
                  lines with similar physics and operating characteristics — where traditional approaches
                  would require separate physcial meters at each location.
