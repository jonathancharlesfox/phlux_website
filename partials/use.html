            <h3>Virtual flow metering</h3>
            <p>
              Estimate flow rates for pumps, compressors, and oil &amp; gas wells using pressure, temperature,
              and other available signals. Applicable across single- and multi-phase fluids, enabling flow insight
              where physical meters are impractical, costly, or unavailable.

            <h3>Equipment condition inference</h3>
            <p>
              Infer equipment condition and performance loss from system response over time. Operational state
              classification and alerting are layered on top to highlight off-normal behavior and support
              troubleshooting before issues escalate.

            <h3>Embedded OEM &amp; system integrations</h3>
            <p>
              Work directly with equipment manufacturers or system vendors to embed inference capabilities
              into existing products and control architectures, extending measurement and diagnostics
              without adding field instrumentation.
